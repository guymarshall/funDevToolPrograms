# Welcome to my silly repository of even sillier programs to enter into the console.

These programs **do not** alter any data on the site you use them on, and they **do not** send/receive any data. They just change the appearance of the items on the page.

# Rules

There are no rules apart from please have fun, use 4 spaces per tab if possible, and use more modern features of JavaScript like let and const instead of var please!
